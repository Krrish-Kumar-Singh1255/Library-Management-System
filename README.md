## 🧠 Overview
This project is a **Library Management System** implemented in **C++**.  
It demonstrates important **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as:
- Classes and Objects  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism (Virtual Functions)  
- Friend Functions and Classes  
- Dynamic Memory Allocation and Destructors  

The system allows an admin to manage both **Books** and **EBooks** efficiently.

## ⚙️ Features
- ➕ Add new **Books** or **EBooks**  
- 📚 Display all available books  
- 🔍 Search for a specific book by title and author  
- 💰 Compare prices between two books  
- ✏️ Update book details (title, author, or price)  
- ❌ Delete a book safely using dynamic memory deallocation  
- 🔑 Admin login system for secure access

## 🧩 Classes Used
- **`Book`** – Base class storing title, author, and price  
- **`EBook`** – Derived class from `Book`, adds a `filesize` attribute  
- **`Library`** – Manages a dynamic array of books (add, search, update, delete, display)

2. Copy the code from `LibraryManagement.cpp`.  
3. Compile and run the program.  
4. Enter the login credentials when prompted.  
5. Use the menu to perform library operations.
